  # Summary

  The PETRARCH2 coding program implements a new coding algorithm, based on a
  syntactic constiuency parse, to extract who-did-what-to-whom events from
  structured news stories. Events are coded according to the CAMEO [@cameo] coding
  ontology. This software improves upon previous-generation coding software
  such as TABARI [@tabari].
